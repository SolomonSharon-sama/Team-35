# Team-35
The tasks i carried out during the Zur Project Phase Training for Studept

Problem: What exactly are we solving? and what does this do for our users?
Solution: I interviewed a prorietor and created a survey to reach more priorietors, this helped me understand what the schools go through and how we can create a solution for them to help ease the strain debts cause on the schools 

Carried out survey during the research stage

After the research, we came together as a design team and began to break down our processes into actionable steps, we also began to prioritize features that would help schools manage their debts during this stage we decided that a school should have the ability to add debtors, update their records, debtors should also be ale to contend a debt, and schools should be able to respond to these appeals. i created a userflow for the onboarding of users and relevant screens for the features
